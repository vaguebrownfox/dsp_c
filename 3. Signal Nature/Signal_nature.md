mean | mu : sum of signed samples divided by the size.
deviation | variance : sum of difference between samples and the mean value divided by the size.
std. dev. | sigma : square root of the variance.
Power (P) is proportional to Voltage (V) squared.
Root Mean Squared | RMS : squared samples divided by the size, under square root.
mean is the DC component
std. dev. measures AC portion of the signal
if RMS == std. dev. => there is no DC component

mean measures whats being measured
std. dev represents noise and other interferences
Signal to Noise Ratio | SNR : mean over std. dev.
Coefficient of Variation | CV : SNR \* 100
