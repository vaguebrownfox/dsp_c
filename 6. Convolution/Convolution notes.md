Convolution

-   very important
-   mathematical way of combining two signals
-   a way of combining two signals to obtain third resultant signal
-   Relates three important signals of interest
    -   Input signal
    -   Output signal
    -   Response
-   Decomposition:
    -   Impulse decomposition
    -   Fourier decomposition
-   Impulse decomposition: a way to analyze a signal one sample at a time
-   When impulse decomposition is used in the process of combining two signal: the procedure can be described mathematically as convolution

# 2

-   Delta function: normalised impulse signal | unit impulse
    -   del[3] = 0001000...
-   del[n] -> /system/ -> h[n]
-   h[n] : impulse response
-   if two systems are different, they'll have different impulse response
